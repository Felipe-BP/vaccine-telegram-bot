# Vaccine Telegram Bot

I decided to implement a Telegram Bot, that helps me to automatically check if the covid-19 vaccine is available for me into where I live. I do, but with tecnologies that I love and a couple that I wanted to put in pratice for learning purposes.

Obviously I'm using Typescript to code (It's my preferred language ðŸ’—ðŸš€), Telegraf was used to abstract and handle the integration with the Telegram API (it helped me a lot), and last, Serverless Framework to develop and deploy into a AWS Lambda. So, if you are looking for a Telegram Bot with those tecnologies, this repository could be a good start point.
